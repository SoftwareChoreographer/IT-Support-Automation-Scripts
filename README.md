## 🔧 Customization & Extension

All scripts are designed to be easily modified:

```powershell
# NetworkRepair.ps1 - Add custom test sites
$TestSites = @("8.8.8.8", "google.com", "yourcompany.com")

# DiskCleaner.py - Add custom cleanup locations
custom_paths = [
    "C:\\MyApp\\TempFiles",
    "D:\\ProjectCache"  
]

# UserAccountManager.ps1 - Modify default groups
$DefaultGroups = @("Domain Users", "VPN Access", "Email Users")
```

## 🚀 Deployment Scenarios

### Help Desk Integration
```bash
# Add to help desk toolkit folder
C:\IT-Tools\NetworkRepair.ps1
C:\IT-Tools\DiskCleaner.py

# Create desktop shortcuts for technicians
# Include in new hire onboarding checklist
```

### Self-Service Portal
```html
<!-- Add to company intranet -->
<a href="\\shared\scripts\DiskCleaner.py">🧹 Clean My Computer</a>
<a href="\\shared\scripts\NetworkRepair.ps1">🔧 Fix Network Issues</a>
```

### Scheduled Maintenance
```powershell
# Windows Task Scheduler - Weekly disk cleanup
schtasks /create /tn "AutoDiskCleanup" /tr "python C:\Scripts\DiskCleaner.py" /sc weekly
```

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

### Built-in Safeguards
- ✅ **Non-destructive operations** - Won't break systems
- ✅ **Safe file locations only** - No user documents touched
- ✅ **Permission checking** - Gracefully handles access denied
- ✅ **Dry-run capabilities** - Preview before making changes
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** - Full audit trail of actions

### Risk Assessment
| Risk Level | Operations | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 🟢 **Low** | DNS flush, temp cleanup | Built-in Windows/OS features |
| 🟡 **Medium** | TCP/IP reset, IP renewal | Automatic recovery, restart prompt |
| 🔴 **High** | User account creation | Dry-run mode, validation checks |
